# Java 9 introduced several key features:

1. **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)** - Also known as Project Jigsaw, modularizes the JDK to improve scalability and security.
2. **JShell (REPL)** - A command-line tool for running and testing Java code interactively.
3. **Collection Factory Methods** - Convenient methods to create immutable lists, sets, and maps.
4. **Private Interface Methods** - Allows private methods within interfaces to avoid redundancy.
5. **Stream API Improvements** - Adds new methods like `takeWhile`, `dropWhile`, and `iterate`.
6. **Optional Enhancements** - Adds methods like `ifPresentOrElse` and `or`.
7. **HTTP/2 Client (Incubator)** - Introduces an API for HTTP/2 and WebSocket communication (later standardized in Java 11).
8. **Multi-Release JAR Files** - Supports different versions of Java in a single JAR.

These enhancements focused on modularization, developer productivity, and improved API features.

<b> Collection Factory Methods - </b><br/>

This provide a quick way to create immutable collectionsâ€”meaning collections that cannot be modified once created. These methods are available in the List, Set, and Map interfaces, allowing developers to create unmodifiable collections more succinctly.<br/><br/>
**Characteristics** <br/>
**Immutable:** Attempting to add or remove elements from these collections will throw UnsupportedOperationException.<br/>
**Compact Syntax:** Reduces the verbosity of initializing collections, especially small ones.<br/>
<br/>
These factory methods are highly useful for creating constant collections and simplifying code structure.
