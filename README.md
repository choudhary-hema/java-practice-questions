# Collection Factory Methods 
**Collection Factory Methods** provide a quick way to create immutable collectionsâ€”meaning collections that cannot be modified once created. These methods are available in the List, Set, and Map interfaces, allowing developers to create unmodifiable collections more succinctly.<br/>
**Characteristics** Immutable: Attempting to add or remove elements from these collections will throw UnsupportedOperationException.
Compact Syntax: Reduces the verbosity of initializing collections, especially small ones.
These factory methods are highly useful for creating constant collections and simplifying code structure.
